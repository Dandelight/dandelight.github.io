  abstract  = {For senior-year or first-year graduate level robotics courses generally taught from the mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, or computer science departments. Since its original publication in 1986, Craig's Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control has been the market's leading textbook used for teaching robotics at the university level. With perhaps one-half of the material from traditional mechanical engineering material, one-fourth control theoretical material, and one-fourth computer science, it covers rigid-body transformations, forward and inverse positional kinematics, velocities and Jacobians of linkages, dynamics, linear control, non-linear control, force control methodologies, mechanical design aspects, and programming of robots.},
